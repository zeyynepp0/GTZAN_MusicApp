## Music Genre Classification and Recommendation App

This project presents a machine learning-based application that classifies the genre of a music file and provides genre-specific song recommendations. All stages, including model development, feature extraction, and UI design, were implemented in MATLAB.

## ðŸ“„ Project Report

[Machine Learning-Based Music Genre Classification.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20725961/Machine.Learning-Based.Music.Genre.Classification.pdf)


## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To automatically detect the genre of an uploaded music file and suggest other tracks from the same genre. The system allows the user to:

- Upload `.wav` music files  
- Play, pause, and visualize the audio waveform  
- Select from pre-trained models  
- Get predictions with genre suggestions

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Tested

A total of 11 different models were trained and tested using the GTZAN dataset:

- Fine, Medium, and Coarse Decision Trees  
- Linear and Quadratic SVM  
- Fine, Medium, and Coarse KNN  
- Boosted Trees  
- Narrow and Medium Neural Networks  

> ðŸŽ¯ **Best Accuracy:** Quadratic SVM (59.8%)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **GTZAN Dataset:** 1000 audio tracks, 10 genres  
- Preprocessed using spectrogram, MFCCs, spectral features, etc.  
- Tools: MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox & Classification Learner App

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used

- MATLAB  
- Signal Processing Toolbox  
- Classification Learner Toolbox  
- Audio Feature Extraction  
- GTZAN Music Dataset
